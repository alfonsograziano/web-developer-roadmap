# The free Web Developer Roadmap for 2023 

## 🆕 Introduction

Becoming a web developer today can be a hard journey. Online there are tons of videos, books, and courses. This can cause analysis paralysis. Also, as a new developer, you can literally learn tens of different languages. There are a few reasons why I decided to create this repository:

- Let you avoid common mistakes
- Provide a free study path accessible to everyone
- Connect the dots between the technologies
- Help you learn tech in the correct way

## 🧠 Assumptions

Unfortunately, in computer science, there is no solution that fits all the requirements. I have to make a few assumptions about you to give you a useful path.

My assumptions are: 

- You are passionate about computer science and you want to learn more
- Your English level is enough to understand videos, books, and articles
- You don’t have past working experience in this field
- All the listed resources are free
- You have basics tech skills, like using a computer, installing software, and using the web

## 📚 How to use this guide

As you’ll see in the next section, I divided the study into multiple weeks. I assume a daily study of 5h/day, 6 days/week (30hrs/week). If you can’t afford this rhythm (which is totally fine), just keep in mind that this is not a race, you can take your time.

You’ll find a few checkboxes, feel free to copy this document (or fork it as we will see later) and check the checkbox as soon as you finish an activity. 

You’ll find activities related to hard and soft skills. Being a good developer is not about writing code. 

Ready? Let’s get started! 🚀



## Time to study

### 🔨 Week 1 - Introduction & Tools

#### Week description

In this first week, we’ll make a basic introduction to programming and how the Internet works. Then we will learn the basics of VSCode (a text editor used to write software) and Git (a tool used to version our code). Also, we will create a basic Linkedin profile to reach out to other developers and grow our network.

#### Why it matters

Starting with a basic computer science and Internet understanding is fundamental in a Web Development roadmap

In the first week, you need to setup your tools. You need: 

- A computer
- A good internet connection (you’ll see a lot of videos)

The first weeks are the most complex, you’re going to receive a lot of information, you’ll find weird names and you need to manage multiple complex concepts. Feel free to rewatch a video multiple times if you don’t understand it correctly.

### 🎨 Week 2 - HTML & CSS Basic

#### Week description

HTML & CSS are two of the 3 main components of a frontend web application. 

Like other topics in this roadmap, is virtually impossible to learn them in one week, but we can at least gain a basic understanding of how they work and start experimenting to create a few demo applications. We will cover the HTML & CSS basics, Tailwind and we’re going to create a first presentation Linkedin post.

#### Why it matters

HTML creates the basic structure of a web page. With CSS we can add style, animations, handling responsiveness, and a lot more. Also, joining dev communities is really important and can be a career booster.

    - [ ]  Complete at least [5 challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?languages=HTML|CSS&types=free) with HTML + CSS and publish them on Github
- [ ]  Improve your social presence
    - [ ]  Create your first Linkedin post by explaining who you are, what are you studying, and why you decided to start this journey
    - [ ]  Connect with at least 10 software developers. You can search for them in your city for example.
- [ ]  Join software developer's [Discord communities](https://dev.to/htnguy/top-10-discord-servers-for-developers-559o) and start to interact with them

Right now you should have an understanding of how the DOM works, how to style HTML, and you should already have a few projects on Github, congratulations! 🎉

Keep in mind that this is not programming. HTML and CSS are a way to define what to show on a web browser. Programming is something different, we will see it in the next week.

### ✏️ Week 3 - JS Basics

#### Week description

In this roadmap, we decided to keep just one language to use both on the frontend and on the backend to keep it simpler. Javascript is a powerful language and we’re going to use it to build full-stack complex applications. 

In this first week, we will learn a few basics JS skills and a few Soft Skills for software developers

#### Why it matters

I remember when I started coding for the first time. It was interesting but hard, complex, and a huge topic. In the end, programming is just the first step to becoming a software engineer. The more you exercise, the more you improve your skills. Keep going! 🚀
